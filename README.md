# SSD300
SSD300 neural network model implementation. Developed during Deep Learning course at Vilnius University.  

Based on papers: [SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) and [IoU-balanced Loss Functions for Single-stage Object
Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05641)  
  
This implementation has two variants: one with classic MultiBox loss function as provided in the author's paper and another one, with IoU-balanced loss function.

Models are trained to detect pandas, scissors and snakes in images. The implementation was coded and models were trained in Google Colab environment.
